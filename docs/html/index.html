<h3><img src="w-small.png" alt="[W]">window system</h3>

<p>W is a simple, socket based, mainly two-color window system created
originally by <em>Torsten Scherer</em> and currently "maintained" by
<em>Eero Tamminen</em>.  W has no relation to that X's predecessor with
a same name.  W 1 release 4 main features are:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Uses sockets for communicating with client applications. Works
      either locally or remotely (assumes both ends have same int size).
  <li>Terminal emulator (wterm) with color and mouse support. Wvt
      terminal supports also history and copy / paste.
  <li>Supports line, box, circle, ellipse, pie, polygon and bezier
      graphics functions in solid and patterned modes.  Most support
      only line width of one.
  <li>Replace, clear, invert and transparent graphics modes (block
      and text functions use only replace mode).
  <li>Supports both monospaced and proportional <i>bitmap</i> fonts.
      Different font styles can be achieved either by setting the
      desired font style for the window or by loading an appropiate
      font.  There's a converter for converting X BDF fonts to W
      fonts.
  <li>Graphics primitives are offset to a window and window contents
      are stored by the server (redraws are also performed by the server).
  <li>Server has window manager builtin (focus follows mouse).  Windows
      can have title, close and iconization gadgets.  Windows can be
      resized from any of their borders.
  <li>Windows can have subwindows.  Every window has it's own graphics
      context (graphics mode, pattern, font, color).
  <li>A widget toolkit for easing up user interface creation.  There's
      also an X11 version of the W <i>libary</i> called W2Xlib, so you
      can run and debug your W apps under X too.  Alternatively you can
      run the W <i>server</i> in an X11 window using e.g. the SDL
      backend.
  <li>W window system was mostly designed to be two color (monochome)
      but has also support for 8-bit palettized colors.
  <li>Smallish. W server and applications take about 1/4 of the RAM and
      disk space needed by X11<b>R5</b> (when comparing statically linked
      binaries). Using W server on color mode may increase it's memory
      use over that of X because of the window backup bitmaps though.
  <li>Has been reported at times to work on m68k/x86 Linux, Atari MiNT,
      MacMiNT, SunOS, Amiga NetBSD, Agenda VR at least with one
      graphics device / on some graphics mode.  On Linux there are
      backends for SDL, framebuffer, GGI and SVGAlib. See for
      technical info to see what graphics modes W supports.
</ul>
<p>

<strong>To compile and use W you'll need a small unix like setup (GNU C,
make and linker + unix C-library) with networking (sockets), some
method to access graphics memory linearly, at least 4MB of RAM and
10MB of free disk space.</strong>
