<h3>Available W toolkit applications</h3>

<i>Kay R&ouml;mer</i> has programmed <a href="../wt/">W toolkit</a>
(hence referred as Wt) which contains <a href="#widgets">widgets</a>
with which more complex W programs can be done.  W toolkit works also
on top of my <a href="#W2Xlib">W2X library</a>.<p>

With W toolkit come the following programs done by me and Kay:

<ul>
<i><a href="../wt/">Applications:</a></i>
  <li><a href="../wt/wetscape/">WetScape</a>, almost HTML v1
      conforming WWW-browser with additional JPEG support.  Program has
      a popup for saving documents to a local file.  This comes also
      with a version of the Independent JPEG group's libjpeg source, but
      for example on linux you most likely already have this.
  <li><a href="../wt/wvt/">Wvt</a> is like WTerm, an
      enhanced VT52 terminal emulator. In addition this offers also
      cut/paste and history buffer.
  <li><a href="../wt/waudio/">WAudio</a>, a (ATM 8-bit,
      mono) sample editor that on MiNT uses Kay's MiNT audio device
      and on other platforms /dev/audio for sound output.
  <li><a href="../wt/wchat/">WChat</a>, a program for
      discussing with others over the network.
  <li><a href="../wt/wdraft/">WDraft</a>, a simple drawing
      program.  Currently it's main use is testing out the server
      graphics functionality :-).
  <li><a href="../wt/wedit/">WEdit</a>, a simple text
      editor with <em>fixed line lenght</em> (edittext widget
      limitation).  Contains some goodies like copy/paste support,
      auto-indent, word wrap, paragraph format, search/replace and
      abbreviation expansion.  Buggy.
  <li><a href="../wt/wicone/">WIcone</a> is a slightly
      enhanced version of the iconeditor example in the toolkit Test/
      directory. You could use it to make icons for WStart menus.
  <li><a href="../wt/wstart/">WStart</a>, a program launch
      menu with nested popups. Corresponding directory is (re-)read when
      popup is opened, so if you have a slow disk you might be happier
      with Wlib based Wlaunch.  Programs may have icon and option files.
<br><br><i><a href="../games/">Games and amusements:</a></i>
  <li><a href="../wt/netgames/">Networked board games</a>
      packet includes W and curses interfaces for Gobang, Go, Pente and
      Othello games, a W interface for Chess and servers for Pente, Go
      and Othello games.  You can play games against a server or another
      player across the network.
  <li><a href="../wt/math/">Wt-ant and Wt-hop</a>, "ant" and "hopalong"
      hopalong algorithms with Wt interfaces.
  <li><a href="../wt/warzone/">WarZone</a> is a start for a game like
      DOS Scorched Earth or Amiga Scorched Tanks (or any other of the
      multitude of games like these, the old Atari Ballerburg was a
      bit more original though...). Would somebody like to pick up
      this and continue?
</ul>

<h3><a name="widgets"></a>Available W toolkit widgets</h3>

<ul>
<em>Containers:</em>
  <li>Top, The root widget
  <li>Shell, a window widget
  <li>Box, arranges children in a grid
  <li>Pane, arranges chilren vertically or horizontally
  <li>Packer, arrangement 'parser' like TCL 'packer' widget
  <li>Form, no arranging
<br><br><em>Scrollers:</em>
  <li>Arrow
  <li>Scrollbar
<br><br><em>Buttons</em>, can have both text and an image:
  <li>Pushbutton
  <li>Radiobutton
  <li>Checkbutton
  <li>Label
<br><br><em>Lists:</em>
  <li>Text list
  <li>Popup, hierachical, items can include an image or checkmark
  <li>Menu, composed of Pushbuttons
<br><br><em>Text output:</em>
  <li>Text
  <li>Html, almost v1.0 conforming
  <li>Vt, enhanced vt52 terminal emulation
<br><br><em>Text input:</em>
  <li>Getstring, with scrolling and cut/paste
  <li>Edittext, with cut/paste and some text formatting
<br><br><em>scrollable lists:</em>
  <li>Listbox, text list with scrollbar
  <li>Select, getstring, arrow and pop-up listbox
  <li>Filselector, Include an autolocator, file mask and sorting options
<br><br><em>Range selection:</em>

<br><br><em>Others:</em>
  <li>Iconedit
  <li>Editable, could be drawn onto and transfers events
  <li>Topwindow, could be used as the icon window
</ul>
<p>

A typical widget hierarchy would be something like this:
<ul><li><em>Top</em>, Widget root
    <ul><li><em>Shell</em>, The window
        <ul><li><em>Pane</em>, vertical
            <ul><li><em>Getstring</em>, "Text"
	    </ul>
	    <li><em>Pane</em>, horizontal
	    <ul><li><em>Pushbutton</em>, "OK"
	        <li><em>Pushbutton</em>, "Cancel"
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Other projects</h3>

<a name="W2Xlib" href="../w2xlib/">W2X library</a> implements W
library/server functionality on top of X11 library and server.  It's
complete enough so that you can compile and use all the W library and
toolkit programs (except wsaver and wgone for which you should use your
X counterparts).  It implements only monochrome W server function /
functionality.  You should unpack the tar-ball to W directory so that
symlinks into W library sources will get right.<p>

<a href="http://koti.welho.com/kmattil4/">Mortar</a> is a simple 2-4
player game where players shoot each other with cannons one player at
the time. It has raytraced graphics and works on Linux (framebuffer,
SDL, GGI), Atari (MiNT) or Amiga and DOS.<p>

There are also <a href="../diffs/">diffs</a> for some programs
(Heretic, Xmountains) to get them to work with W window system.<p>

<h3>Obsolete Notes</h3>

I have earlier made a <i>MiNT FLI Player</i> from x86-linux SVGAlib
FLI player sources.  It doesn't work on x86-linux anymore, so I
suspect that I have introduced some bugs to the (v0.3 <em>flip</em>)
code, but it seems to works well (haven't got memory protection on
with MiNT...).  I even added scaling to it which worked reasonably
fast.<p>

I had also implemented Basic W1R3-pl2 W Library functionality in <a
href="http://www.modeemi.cs.tut.fi/~puujalka/python.html#wlib">Python</a>.
There was also Python version of my L-system parser which could output
the grammar also either into W window or POV scene.<p>

Other programs of interest with W and non-GEM MiNT usage in general
were J&uuml;rgen Lock's <em>virtual consoles</em> and Johan Klockars'
<a href="http://rand.thn.htu.se">MGIF</a>.  Linux has builtin virtual
consoles and for image manipulation I recommend <a
href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a>. <p>
