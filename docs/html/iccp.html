<h2>W Inter-Client Communication Protocol Draft</h2>

W will (1998? :)) provide two mechanisms for client communication;
messages and clipboard for passing data.


<h3>Clipboard</h3>

Clipboard can be used for providing data either globally or for a
specific application.  An example of the global way would be the
painting of text in one window with left mouse button and then pasting
it into another window with a right mouse button.  Drag & drop will
need use of messages and of private clip types.<p>


<h4>Interface:</h4>

<code>
	<li>short w_putselection(char *type, char *data, long length, short lock);<p>
</code>

Will send the 'data' data of 'length' length to clipboard under 'type'
identification.  `Lock' should be set when another program asks for the
data.  It will prevent other programs from (accidentally) `corrupting'
i.e.  overwriting the data.  Returns NULL for failure.<p>

<code>
	<li>w_selection_t *w_getselection(char *type, short unlock);<p>
</code>

Will get clipboard data with 'type' identification.  Returns the
acquired clip or NULL if requested failed. If `unlock' is set, will
free the write-lock on the clip. This should be used when reading
data that was requested from another program.<p>

<code>
	<li>w_freeselection(w_selection_t *);<p>
</code>

Frees the memory allocated for the clip by the w_getselection() call.<p>

<code>
	<li>w_clipboard_t w_selopen(char *type);<p>
</code>

Will open a clip of type `type' and return handle to clip or NULL.<p>

<code>
	<li>w_clipboard_t w_selappend(w_clipboard_t, char *data, long length, short lock);<p>
</code>

Will append data into earlier opened clip.<p>

<code>
	<li>void w_selclose(w_clipboard_t);<p>
</code>

Closes and flushes an earlier opened clip.<p>

<code>
	<li>short w_copy_bm(WWIN *win, short x, short y, short w, short h);<p>
</code>

Copies the specified image block into clipboard.  Returns NULL for failure.

<code>
	<li>short w_paste_bm(WWIN *win, short x, short y);<p>
</code>

Pastes the image from clipboard into the specified place.  Returns NULL
for failure.<p>

<code>
	<li>WWIN *w_stat_bm(void);<p>
</code>

Returns the clipboard image information (size and window pointer (for
w_getblock())) or NULL if clipboard is empty.<p>


<h4>Implementation:</h4>

Clipboard could be implemented either in W server, W library or in a
separate server.  Clipboard server receives, stores and send the data
from/to clients.  Data will be stored in files on some directory (could
be configurable) according to their type (= filename).  The type names
could probably be limited to 8-16 characters in Wlib (should be then
mentioned in the docs of course).<p>

There could be `priorities' attached to clips so that clipboard server
would notify other clients (through W messages, see below) about
receiving clips above certain priorities.<p>

Clipboard images (stored on W server so that using them is faster) need
some additional code to the W server.  They would be stored in a hidden
window.<p>

A separate clipboard server could also have a W interface so that user can
manipulate the clips (show, copy, delete them).<p>

Clipboard open, append and close functions would probably be implemented
completely in the W library.

W_SEL_TEXT would be the `default' clip type and should be used
exclusively for visual text copy / paste operations.  Clients which
don't translate '\t' or '\n' should either ignore or convert to spaces
values that are smaller than 32, not just `show' them (fonts might have
null width chars on those positions and that will disrupt window offsets
for fixed width font programs).<p>

Client specific clip types should include a little identification string,
for example:  "Word.rtf", "Word.pbm".  Client could also provide a more
generic version of it's clip for pasting into other apps.<p>


<h3>Messaging</h3>

Messages are just IDs and clipboard will be used for passing data.
Using application specific clip type identifications, there should be
no confusion (unless of course apps select their names unwisely :)).<p>

Messages will be given to clients as 'EVENT_MESSAGE' events.
The WEVENT structure will be filled like this:<p>

<pre>
	win:	window		(from w_msgwin())
	type:	EVENT_MESSAGE
	x:	message ID
	y:	optional message information
	key:	sender ID	(for w_toClient())
</pre>
<p>

Except for broadcasts (which should be enough for starters), the
messages will need a receiver.  Therefore clients that can accept
messages, will have to register themselves.<p>


<h4>Interface:</h4>

<code>
	<li>void w_register(char *name, char *category, long version);<p>
</code>

Registers the client with given attributes. Usually done right after
w_init().<p>

<code>
	<li>short w_broadcast(short msg_id, short msg_arg, char *category);<p>
</code>

Sends the message to all the registered clients in 'category' category.
If 'category' is NULL, will send message to all registered clients.
Returns number of clients (or maybe just non-zero if there were clients)
to which message was sent.<p>

<code>
	<li>long w_clientID(char *client_name, long version);<p>
</code>

Returns the ID for the first client registered with given name.  Clients
whose version number is smaller than the given one, will be ignored.  If
client wasn't found, returns zero.<p>

<code>
	<li>short w_toClient(long id, short msg_id, short msg_arg);<p>
</code>

Sends a 'msg' message to 'id' client. Returns zero if given client
wasn't registered.<p>

<code>
	<li>short w_msgwin(short x, short y, short msg_id, short msg_arg);<p>
</code>

Sends message to the client owning the window at position (x,y). This
function is vital for drag&drop implementation.<p>


<h4>Implementation:</h4>

<code>
	<li>void  w_register(char *name, char *category, long version);
</code>

Server should have some new CLIENT structure members for storing the
client name, category and version.  The name strings could be limited to
16-32 characters and category to same length as the clipboard types.<p>

<code>
	<li>long  w_clientID(char *client_name, long version);
	<li>short w_toClient(long id, short msg_id short msg_arg);<p>
</code>

The id is the CLIENT structure pointer/id.<p>

<code>
	<li>short w_msgwin(short x, short y, short msg_id, short msg_arg);<p>
</code>

Search the window that is visible at the SCREEN (x,y) co-ordinates and
then send it's owner a message WEVENT with this window id.  Other
messages could use WROOT as their WEVENT 'win' member.<p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

Probably the most important application for the messages and clipboard
would be drag and drop. For clipboard the main usage would be cut & paste.

Drag and drop will be nice when somebody starts to build a W file manager
(start programs by clicking on their data files, or e.g.  change the
image to display just by dropping it to application window etc.).
However, W file manager might need some other changes to Wserver too.
Here's how drag-and-drop would work:<p>

<ol>
  <li>When mouse button is released, restore icon's original position.
  <li>Get release co-ordinates (they are relative to source window).
  <li>From that calculate mouse position on ROOT window.
  <li>Then get the window under the given co-ordinates.
  <li>And 'drop' the icon to the client owning that window.
  <ol>
	<li>Save and lock the path and filename to the dropped file
	    (dd.file).  Instead of a file, there could also be text
	    (dd.text) or whatever.
	<li>Send drop message about the file for the window owner.
	<li>Window owner will read and unlock the filename...
	<li>...And act accordingly.
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>

This would also need sub windows (icons) to be movable out of their parent
window(s).<p>


Changing the W Toolkit widgets to use a server clipboard instead of the
toolkit one would be easy to fix, but handling the messages would need a
bit more code.  Maybe wt_top_class could be setopt() with application
registration values and message handler callback?  These would take
effect immediately.<p>

If there's a lot of data to move (continuously) between specific
applications, they should use Wserver just for contacting each other for
an exchange of socket addresses and further on do all their
communications by direct contacts.  All this could probably be handled
transparently with a special W Toolkit widget?<p>
