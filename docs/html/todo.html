<h3>Wish / TODO list for W</h3>

These are features desired for current W version (W1R4).  The ones
marked with a `*' are considered to be the most important.  Some might
not get implemented at all.

<ul>
<p><em>Graphics drivers and backends</em>:
  <li>Key mapping and special key handling for the Linux framebuffer. *
  <li>Support for Linux input core mouse (get rid of GPM). *
  <li>Adding graphics modes for text and bitblit functions. These go
      together because text clipping is implemented with blitting.
  <li>Complete different line widths support.
  <li>Support vector fonts (using freetype2).
  <li>16-bit framebuffer graphics driver (-> use SDL emulation instead)

<p><em>W server / library</em>:
  <li>Fix clipboard handling. *
  <li>Improve palette handling so that there's less flickering when
       changing window focus.
  <li>User selectable clip rectangle (graphics drivers already do clipping).
  <li>Graphics contexts separated from windows.  This would be necessary
      <em>only</em> in situations where separate clients want to write
      to the same window (mainly means root window amusements).
  <li>Using shared memory to transfer application images to server
      when on the same machine.
  <li><a href="fserver.html">Font server</a>.  Would take care of font
      loading, conversion (e.g.  from vector to bitmap), style applying,
      font substitution and sending of them to server.
  <li><a href="iccp.html">Client registration and communication with W
      message events</a>.  Coupled with clipboard this could be used for
      implementing Drag-an'-Drop.
  <li>Support unicode strings and fonts (UCS-16 or UTF-8?)

<p><em>W toolkit</em>:
  <li>A style guide on widget programming. *
  <li>Listbox widget with horizontal scrolling and multiple selections. *
  <li>Window based focus to W Toolkit + focus changing shortcuts.
      Currently focus is app specific. *
  <li>Properties / help attribute for widgets, of which help would be
      handled automatically if it's available.
  <li>Visual grouping / separation of W toolkit components on screen.
      The trouble is that containers are just that, they can't contain
      graphics (e.g. box around radio button group).
  <li>Update HTML widget to interpret at least HTML v2.0 instead of the
      current ~v1.0.

<p><em>Applications</em>:
  <li>File manager / file type associated program launcher.
  <li>Add more HTML features to Wetscape (html widget).
  <li>Other networked applications like mail and ftp.
  <li>Different kind of editors (text, font, image, sound, music)...
  <li>Wt interface builder.
</ul>
