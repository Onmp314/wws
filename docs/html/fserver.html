FONT SUBSTITUTION AND SERVER DRAFT


* There should be a user definable default font which most apps (needing
only one font) would use.

* If a font that app requests isn't available, server will substitute
another font.  App can specify which substitutions (family, size, style)
are allowed.

* Emulating styles which aren't available, by on-the-fly generated W
server font `effects'.  This will happen transparently from the
application point of view (Wlib could be aware of this so that it
doesn't need to store the font width etc.  information twice) either in
font or W server.  Fonts will have a mask which specifies which effects
can be used (will be readable) with the font.

(As computer generates certain effects (underline, reverse) as well as
humans it's most memory efficient to generate them exclusively on the
W server. However user should have an option to generate them beforehand
with either a separate program or in font server (startup options).

FONT FILES

Font file structure:
struct {
	long magic;			/* font `generation' id */
	short header;			/* header length up to `widths' */
	long length;			/* font data length */

/* font type */
	char family[16];		/* font family name */
	short height;			/* font size */
	ushort flags;			/* proportional, CHARSET etc. */
	ushort styles;			/* styles implemented in font */

/* style effect variables */
	short thicken;			/* `boldness' */
	short slant_size;		/* slanting width increase */
	short slant_offset;		/* italic correction */
	ushort skew;			/* slanting pattern */
	ushort lighten;			/* pattern for light effect */
	ushort effect_mask;		/* usable (=readable) style effects */

/* font cell information */
	short baseline;			/* offset for vertical aligning */
	short maxwidth;			/* width of the widest char */
	short top;			/* empty rows above chars */
	short bottom;			/* -"- below chars */
	short left;			/* empty columns left of chars */
	short right;			/* -"- right of chars */
} HEADER;

/*variable length, optional strings */
	char info[];			/* font purpose, author etc. */

/* the font data itself */
	uchar widths[256];		/* individual character widths */
	ulong data[];			/* font bitstreams */

`Info' member can be shown with the font header manipulation program,
others can ignore it.  Font editor should know also of different
`generations' of W fonts and to be able to convert between them.


FONT SERVER STRUCTS AND SUBSTITUTION

Font server will eventually implement the following functionality
(probably in the order given):
	1) send requested font to the W server
	2) do byte order conversions to font for the W server
	3) replace non-existing fonts with the default one
	4) precalculate font effects according to font server options
	5) check whether W server already has requested font
	6) take care of font family / size / style substitutions

From 5) onwards font server will maintain lists of what fonts W
server(s) has received (so that W server will not be sent a font that it
already has).  These lists start from a alphabetically sorted font
family names, which point into different sizes under it in increasing
order, which point to different font styles in that size.  There are
separate lists so that searching the fonts and finding a substitute will
be faster.

Font server font structures on phase:
	FAMILY *next;		/* pointer to next struct in list */
	char family[];		/* font family name */
	FSIZE *sizes;		/* pointer to font sizes in this family */

	FSIZE *next;		/* pointer to next struct in list */
	short height;		/* font size */
	FSTYLE *styles;		/* pointer to font styles in this size */

	FSTYLE *next;		/* pointer to next struct in list */
	short styles;		/* styles in the font */
	short effects;		/* on-the-fly in W server generated styles */
	short effect_mask;	/* effects that W server may apply to font */
	FREF *font;		/* pointer to font in W server (see below) */

`effect_mask' tells which on-the-fly generated (on W server) style
effects are readable (i.e.  can be used for fallbacks) with the font in
question.

If app doesn't require any of the attributes to be exact, font
substitution works like this:
	0) exact font
	1) exact family & size, on-the-fly style effect
	2) exact family & size, normal style
	3) exact family, default size, exact style
	4) exact family, default size, on-the-fly style effect
	5) exact family, default size
	6) default family, exact size & style
	7) default family, exact size, on-the-fly style effect
	8) default family, exact size, default style
	9) default family & default size, exact style
	10) default family & default size, on-the-fly style effect
	11) default font

font server checks with every substitution level whether W server
already has the substitute, then it will try to load substitute from
file (and link it to lists).

If requested font family / size doesn't have the requested style flag in
the effect_mask, the style request will be ignored.

If default size is greater than the requested one, a size just below
the requested size will be used (remember that sizes are also sorted
and that font family member will point to the smallest size).

App can also specify which font attributes have to be exact (or
generated on-the-fly). This will lead into skipping some of the
substitution steps.

Font server has an option for specifying which effects should be added
to font in the font server before it's sent to W server.  That way user
can control the memory v.  speed (generating effects when drawing the
characters is of course slower) issue.  Font server generated italic
will widen the characters as does bolding of a proportional font.
Font server will do effects by converting font bitstreams to bitmaps,
applying effects and then converting bitmaps back to bitstreams.

Default font is the first one requested by the W server.


W SERVER STRUCTS

W server font resources (FONT):
	HEADER *header;		/* members in font files up to `info' */
	uchar widths[256];	/* character widths */
	long offsets[256];	/* offsets into char specific bitstreams */
	ulong *data;		/* character bitstreams */
	short refcount;		/* number of references to font */

W server font references (FREF):
	short effects;		/* style effects to calculate on-the-fly */
	FONT *font;		/* pointer to above structure */

Currently possible on-the-fly style effects (in any combinations) are:
bold, italic, underline, reverse and light.  Italics (actually slanted
pseudo italics) should be done in the server if character widths should
be same for italic and normal styles.  Server generated bold will be
inferior to hand crafted (or in some cases even to font server generated)
style.


WLIB STRUCTS

Wlib font resource (WFONT):
	WFONT *next;
	short refcount;		/* number of references to font */
	FREF *font;		/* pointer to W server font reference */
	HEADER header;		
	uchar widths[256];	/* character widths */

---------------------

FONT LOADING CHAIN

Wlib:	w_loadfont(char *family, int size, int styles, int required);

Will check whether that font has already been loaded from the font list.
If it hasn't been, Wlib asks W server to load one.
Font request packet:
	short len;
	short type;
	short styles;
	short size;
	short req_flags;
	short res;
	char family[16];

`Required' is a mask of attributes that has to be satisfied:  font
family (if requesting a symbol font or one with a special character
mappings (e.g.  for DOS, ISO latin-1, Atari, TeX character sets)), size
or style.  Giving empty family string or zero size will tell server to
use default values.


Wserver:

When starting, W server will read from the configuration file default
file family and size.  Then W server connects the font server and asks
for the default font.  If font server or default font isn't available, W
server will abort.

When a client font request arrives, W server will forward the request
to the font server.

Font server will check whether *W server* already has the font:

A) If it does, font server will tell W server where the font is (returns
a `you already received that font' packet with the W server font
structure reference address) and what effects to generate when using it.

B) Otherwise font server tries to load the font or a substitution (see
above).  Then font server will send W server the font header and data.
W server will reply with a pointer into the new W server font structure.

Server will increase the font reference counter, generate a new
reference to the font and return address to that for the application.
In case A) that will be sufficient if Wlib also uses font references.
On case B) all the other font information has to be sent to Wlib too.


Application
          ^
    |     | font already
    v     | loaded
   Wlib --
                             ^ send font
    |                        | info to
    v                        | Wlib
 W server      -------------- --------------
              ^ W server       | return     ^
    |         | already got    | font addr  | send font
    v         | the font       v            | to W server
font server --
         ^                                  ^
    |    | check the                        | Font found,
    v    v fallbacks                        | load it.
font file ----------------------------------


UNLOADING A FONT

When client deletes a font, reference counter will be first decreased in
Wlib.  When Wlib counter goes to zero, W server is told to delete the
font.  When W server font reference count goes to zero, font server will
be told to delete font list member for that font.


NOTES

Wlib function w_strlen() will not give the full string extent for a W
server generated slanted font.  For them there could be another,
	w_strextent(WFONT *f, char *s, short *x, short *y, short *w, short *h)

function that would return y & h baseline based and x & w based on
w_strlen() call and slant_size / slant_offset. Wlib should then be
aware of which of the text styles are generated in the W server!
