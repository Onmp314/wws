W COPYRIGHT(S)

Torsten Scherer and Kay Roemer agreed on changing the W copyright to a
better known/defined ones, in this case GPL and LGPL, the GNU General
Public Licences for applications and libraries.  Official W version 1,
revision 4 is the first version with these copyrights.  The licence text
for Wlib and W2Xlib libraries is in the file 'LGPL' and the licence
text for other files is in the file 'GPL', unless otherwise noted in
the actual source file.

Most of the W code will now be under these licences, but there are some
files where other copyrights apply.  Most notably exceptions are W fonts
which are converted from fonts coming with the XFree86 X11 server.  If
you intend to use W package more seriously, please check the respective
licences and copyrights for those.  W 'cour' family is converted from
Courier, 'fixed' from Fixed, 'lucidat' from Lucidatypewriter and 'book'
from New Century Schoolbook X bitmap font family.  'vga16.wfnt' font
is converted from 'vga.bdf' font coming with GPL Linux Dosemu source.

Other files having copyrights differing from GPL/LGPL are:
	fonts/bdf2wfnt.c (free)
	server/xconout2/mint/* (MiNT Copyright)
	server/graph/generic/generic_bezier.c (free?)
	w2xlib/bezier.c (free?)
	lib/isqrt.c (free?)
	wlua/wlua5.c (MIT)
	wlua/wlua4.c (zlib)

This list may be incomplete, see the actual source files for more
accurate information.


COPYRIGHT REASONING

There were already some files covered by the (L)GPL licences, so the
choice was quite obvious.  These files were:
	apps/basename.c
	apps/wsaver/bounce.c
	apps/wsaver/stars.c
	demos/warp.c
	games/wdragon/*
	server/util/*
