# DEC OSF-1 defines
#
# This is intended just for testing 64-bit Wlib and clients
# and communication between 32<->64 bit server and clients.
#
# So there aren't yet any graphics drivers defined
#
# ***NOTE***
# - This hasn't been tested yet.
# - When trying to connect 32-bit W server, you need either
#   16-bit shorts and 32-bit longs or some define magic
#   for the W request packet structure members.
#
# make has to be GNU make and C compiler preferably gcc.
