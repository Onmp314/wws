Here are some fairly trivial scripts easing W usage:
	startw		start W and direct messages to ~/.w-errors
	wmouse-on	wterm mouse reports on
	wmouse-off	wterm mouse reports off
	wview		view given images on color W server
	xbm2w		XBM data conversion to W BM_PACKEDMONO data

The last four scripts need also 'djpeg' and 'giftopnm' programs.


Benjamin C. W. Sittler provided also two scripts to ease W usage:
	won		W version of xon
	wrootpic	show image on W root window (edit before use!)


I've done also some scripts for W maintenance and testing:
	replace.sh	replace strings in files matching a pattern
	wup.sh		update W while preserving old makefiles


You can 'cat' VT52.txt and colors.txt files to test WTerm font styles
and color capabilities.  The first file also documents some of the ESC
codes used by wterm.  Only special key (arrow, function etc) codes
should differ from those.


The scripts need POSIX compliant shell (/bin/sh) for the ${var%expr} etc
string operations.
