1996
- Started initial version (although I hadn't got X for MiNT anymore :))
  using my grafix library as starting point (hence the ugly coding style).

8/1997 (got now again X and it's manual pages)
- Fixed w_queryevent() and text functions (to use root GC instead of the
  window GC).
- Implemented w_settitle().
- Added beginnings for pattern stuff. Modified box.c, circle.c, poly.c
  and settings.c.

9/1997
- Applied changes for W v1, revision 3, beta patchlevel 2.
- Added ellipse and bezier function.
- Pattern functions use now the W default pattern (can't be changed).

10/1997
- Changed to work with my own W v1, revision 4, alpha release.
- Added quite a few functions and fixed stuff so much that W2Xlib
  works now also with W toolkit to some extent.
- Normal W windows will now use one pixmap for backup and two GCs
  for regular and patterned graphics operations. W container windows
  don't/can't have pixmap nor GCs.

11/1997
- Almost all W and W toolkit applications work now with W2Xlib!
- Most of W font functionality is mapped to X fonts.
- *Lots* of other changes / fixes.

12/1997
- Implemented pattern setting.

1/1998
- Implemented line width and pattern data settings.

2/1998
- Added arc and pie functions.
- Fixed dhline, dvline and dline to use fillgc instead of regular gc.
- Added color function stubs so that color programs can be at least compiled.
- Added a couple of links for new Wlib sources.
- Added WWIN<->ID functions.
- Added w_test().

3/1998
- Andreas Beck (hi!)  told the magic incantation 'ConnectionNumber' for
  getting the X file descriptor so that queryevent file descriptor
  selecting works now very nicely (at least for my networked board games
  :)).

6/1998
- Acommodated some Wlib changes.

1/1999
- Added link generation.
- Added KeySym -> W sym conversion.

4/1999
- Fixed w_putblock() flush region so that putblock'ed window contents
  are updated as they should.

TODO
- Make Wt popup windows come onto screen without user interaction.
- Check new attribute against old to see whether change is really needed.
- Mouse shape setting (w_set/getmousepointer()).
- Implement color functions.
- Clean up and optimize code (especially block.c).
