Hello,
	I'd like to submit the Dragon program for distribution.

There is a README file with a quickie blurb, a .man page for documentation,
an Imakefile for building, a Makefile that only knows how to imake the
Imakefile to create a real Makefile, and the program source code itself.

I've done one test install with this file so I'm certain that I've included
all of the source and fairly sure that any site should be able to build
the game.

There is no copyright or distribution restriction on this program.  I am the
author.
