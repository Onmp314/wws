CHANGES

++eero, 11/97
- Converted tile bitmaps from shorts to bytes for endian neutralness.
++eero, 6/98
- Fixed double clicking so that it removes only legal tiles.
- Added tile shadows and enlargened their default width.
- Added +1 to tile shadow clearing width.

Btw. Did you notice that WDragon doesn't use W fonts?  It draws
the texts on the buttons with lines...

This is a port of the "Dragon" program for X11 to W1R3 on the Atari ST.
The port is not yet complete; specifically,

	- double-clicking doesn't work
	- some of the graphics options (reverse video, tile shadows)
	  don't work (due to missing functionality in W)
	- some tiles aren't highlighted properly

I'd also like to add some nicer bitmaps.

As distributed, the program uses only the smallest of the available bitmaps.
If you want larger windows, change the N_BITMAP_SIZES parameter in the
Makefile.  I have only a plain Atari ST with monochrome monitor, and I
can't use any of the larger sizes.

Have fun,

	Jens.

Dragon is a game.  It implements a version of the ancient game of Mah-Jongg.

Dragon is known to work on a Sun 3/60 running SunOS 3.5 with X11R3 from
MIT.  It compiles with the Sun compiler and with gcc version 1.31.

I have been told that the current version (this one right here) runs
correctly on monochrome, gray-scale, and color DEC equipment.  Presumably
it will run correctly on most servers at this point.

Dragon is a "monochrome" application; it uses two colors; the default
"foreground" color and the default "background" color as defined and
determined by the X Toolkit.

If you do a "make all" initially then the Makefile will be rebuilt using
the MIT imake program.  If you do not have the MIT imake program (or don't
want to use it) then rename the Makefile.Canned file to be Makefile and
hand-edit it for use at your site.

As of this writing, the Athena Dialog widget has a bug that can cause Dragon
to get a segmentation/memory error.  There is code in X11R3/lib/Xaw/Dialog.c
in the SetValues function that looks like this:

********
    {
	Arg args[1];
!	XtSetArg( args[1], XtNlabel, w->dialog.label );
	XtSetValues( w->dialog.labelW, args, XtNumber(args) );
    }
********
it needs to be changed to:
********
    {
	Arg args[1];
!	XtSetArg( args[0], XtNlabel, w->dialog.label );
	XtSetValues( w->dialog.labelW, args, XtNumber(args) );
    }
********
