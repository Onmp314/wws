	W - Jewel

This is a W variant of the game known as Jewel, Columns or Coloris on
other systems.  You try to prevent the 'well' in the window from filling
up by destroying blocks of similar colors (patterns) by lining them
horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

You guide a column with the keys: 4 - column left, 6 - column
right, 5 - roll blocks, 0 - drop column.
