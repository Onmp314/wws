     Wyrms (C) 1995, 1996 by Eero Tamminen


THE GAME

Idea is as old as they come... Eat, grow and avoid obstacles.

Game is intended for two players and there are different versions for
Atari TOS, W and curses.  You can play it also under X with the help of
W2Xlib.


GAME CONTROLS

On TOS the control is with joystick by default.  On other versions both
of the players use keyboard (a,z, x,c ,s and 8,2, 4,6, 5 are the
defaults).


COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

Wyrms expects to get at least one argument as the level on which the
wyrms are about to battle. If level was not found, an empty one will be
created. Command line arguments are (# should be replaced with a
number):

  -w #	How many wyrms players got.

  -s #	Set worm speed (moves per second).

  -b #	Length bonus size in blocks.

  -l #	How much wyrms' length is increased.

  -1 #	Specify which controls (0-3) player one will use.

  -2 #	Specify which controls player two will use.

  -e	Edit the level files given as arguments.

  -h	Shows the help level (help.h).

For example:
	wyrms level.1 -s 4 level.1

would go through level.1 two times, at the second time with half the
speed (8 moves / sec is the default speed).

The normal procedure would be to drag all the level files, one wishes
to play, onto the Wyrms program. Another way would be to install Wyrms
for e.g. *.lev files (and to install default parameters if needed) and
to click onto a level file one wants to play.


BONUSES

Bonuses are something that wyrms can get (in practice, run over).  Some
of the bonuses have immediate effect and others need to be activated or
are activated with a crash into something.  You can have only one bonus
of each type at the time. All the activated bonuses use a common timer.
This means that if you'll hit a speed bonus just after slipping on shit,
you'll end up much farther and faster than you though...

The current bonus tokens are:

A number. Your main goals. Will increase your length and score.
When the number is 9, you'll get to the next level and the opponent
loses a life.

A flash.  Pressing the button will make you to move at double speed for a
little while.  This 'turbo' mode was the thing that originally got me to
write this game.

A leaf.  Eating this makes you able to excrete once, which will increase
your score too).  The one who runs into the crapola, will slide
uncontrollably for a little while.

Explosives. Will get you through the next obstacle you'll crash into
(wall, other player etc.). A head-to-head collision with the other worm
is fatal though.

A key. You'll need this to open a door. Opening a door increases your
score.

An arrow. Player is allowed to go through this item only in the direction
pointed by the arrow. Then the arrow disappears.

The home. You'll pick up another wyrm from your home hole ;-).

BACKGROUND

I have programmed this game in C.  There are a couple of lines GCC
assembler (Motorola & MIT syntax) for handling the IKBD joystick
interrupts on the TOS version.  I used the GCC v2.3.3 with MiNTlibs PL
36 and SozobonX C v2 compilers with the Everest 3.3 and ME-3.5 text
editors under the MiNT v1.12h4 and Thing desktop v0.59 on my 8MHz STfm
(4/30MB) to program and compile this.  My previous programming
experience is about two years of GFA basic programming and a two years
of C programming.


THANKS TO

Johan Klockars for programming the wonderful Mgif image manipulation
program (also free).

Jarkko Kniivil"a on helping me when I started C.  And being a portable
and (especially) modular code fanatic.

J"urgen Lock for arguing with me by E-mail about the relative merits of
GFA Basic and C on spring 1994 when I was still using Gfa... And for the
IMHO most useful MiNT utility -- virtual consoles.

Jerry Geiger and his 'team' for continuously updating SozobonX C (my
'main' hd with GCC/X etc.  stuff broke last fall and it took some time
before I managed to cramp all the needed stuff onto my remaining hd).
At last (August -95) SozobonX has the much awaited prototype
checking <g>.

CHANGES

20.7.1995
- v0.6, the first released version.
- Keyboard control and command line arguments added.

22.7.1995
- v0.7, added an intro screen, bonuses and their actions.

24.7.1995
- v08, added help screen, random length bonuses and better levels
  / worm guiding.

15.8.1995
- v0.9, added scores, level editor and improved the general level wrapper.
- Made a GEM proggie for setting the variables and running Wyrms.
- TOS Wyrms will now restore the system variables (IKBD interrupt
  vectors) also when it's killed.

22.8.1995
- 0.95, X version (uses xsystem.c instead of the system.c).
- Binary level handling improved.
- Game control input is now buffered.
- Player can now have several bonuses. Four new bonuses (arrows).

9.9.1995
- v.96, GEM version. X version fixed.
- Added error() function for short error messages.
- Moved and changed draw_map() into OS specific part.

18.9.1995
- v0.97, Removed intro screen.
- Improved X draw_map().
- Completed the level editor.

19.10.1995
- v0.98, Changed the GEM and X versions to use my Grafix library.
  It might 'poll' a bit more than a native versions, but that
  should be unnoticeble.
- Made a curses (text) version.
- Game can now be interrupted any time.
- Binary levels are centered to the play area.

15.2.1996
- v0.99, Now that GUI versions of wyrms dominate 3 to 2, I decided to add
  some mouse support to the level editing (see level.txt).
- The images are now in 16x8 array of image blocks instead of
  a 1x128 one. That way editing / converting them is easier...
- Made 16x16 bitmaps and added support for them.
- ASCII levels are centered horizontally to the play area.
- Stand alone W version of Wyrms (i.e.  one doesn't need to use my W port
  of the grafix library, Wlib in itself is very easy to program with).

17.2.1996
- v1.0, Some final fixes to the level editor.
- Aligned 16x16 bonus blocks better on the image bitmap.
- Fixed the select timeout timeval struct usage in wait/sys_frame().
  For example Linux didn't like about negative usec values at all...

26.10.1997
- Removed grafix-lib GEM and X versions. X versions can now be done
with the W2Xlib. Maybe somebody will do similar one for GEM too...?
