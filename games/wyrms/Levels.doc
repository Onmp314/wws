THE WYRMS LEVEL EDITOR

With the level editor (start wyrms with '-e' option), you can edit level
files or make your own ones.  '+' and '-' keys will scroll through the
bonuses and the mouse or the keypad number keys (if mouse isn't
available) can be used to position the the selected items/bonuses.

The wyrms starting positions can be defined by setting one body piece
(ie. either black or white) on the the level and the initial heading by
pressing 'h' and giving the direction with the game controls ('button'
gets back to editing).

's' key saves the level and loads next. 'q' loads next level.
ESC exits the editor. If there are no levels, program quits.


BINARY LEVEL FILES

Binary level files are saved by the built-in Wyrms editor. The format is:

- "WYRMS-B" id string.
- Initial wyrm headings.
- The level map.


ASCII LEVEL FILES

I made the ascii format so that levels can be edited with normal
texteditors too.  The format of the level files is:

- One line with the id string "WYRMS-A" (without '"'s).

- One line with two characters specifying the Initial wyrm direction.
  The characters are either 'U', 'D', 'R' or 'L'.

- One line of map conversion information.
  The translation array for the characters on the level map.  The
  characters are in the following order:  background ('gray' dither),
  wall, the home, a door, a key, explosives, a leaf, a turd, a flash,
  a worm head (or a stone) and the player one and player two starting
  places indicators.

  For example this:
    WYRMS-A
    LR
    .#^%=&$?|@<>

  Would mean that '.'  on the map is gray (where the wyrms can move on),
  '#' are walls,,, player one heads left from the position indicated with
  '<' on the map and player two starts right from the position of '>' on
  map.

- The rest of the level file is the map composed of the above characters
  and text.

For further examples see the help level file.
