WETSCAPE WWW-BROWSER

Wetscape is a barely HTML 1.0 compliant WWW-browser with JPEG support
through IJG's (Independent JPEG Group) libjpeg.  It lacks many, many
features common in current WWW-browsers, but on the other hand, it's
also very small.  For HTML parsing it uses the HTML widget in W toolkit.

Wetscape was written by Kay Roemer and patched for current W version
by Eero Tamminen.


WETSCAPE SETTINGS

You can change some wetscape settings such as homepage, bookmark-file
and proxy from the wetscape configuration file '~/.wetscape/config'.

The fonts (size & family) used by HTML widget can be changed from the
W toolkit configuration file `~/.wtrc'.  My own favorite settings are:
	# buttons
	font_normal = fixed
	font_fixed = fixed
	font_size = 10
	# text itself
	html_normal = book
	html_fixed = lucidat
	html_fsize = 13


NOTES

If you get html setopt (code 7 or 40) errors, most probable reason
is that page you're viewing contains some broken image links.


CHANGES

07/2000

++ bsittler 2000.07.04:
- added Host: header to support virtual-hosted HTTP servers

05/1998

- Glibc defines (all?) global variables into functions for sake of
  threading, therefore 'errno' member in 'io_t' struct had to be renamed.

12/1997

- adapted Wetscape for new Wt and W font loading scheme.
- fixed bugs in command line URL name processing.
- added fileselector button for opening of local files.

------ Kay's original readme ------------

Here are the sources for wetscape, a (nearly) HTML 1.0 compliant WWW browser
for W with delayed image loading and some other nice features.

This is an intermediate beta release that is still missing some features and
may have fatal bugs. To run it you need W1R3pl1 with my patches from the
W developers list.
