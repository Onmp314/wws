 The `filesel' widget class
 ----------------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *filesel  = wt_create (wt_filesel_class, <parent>);


 2 Description
 -------------

The filesel widget can be used when asking user for a filepath/name.

Currently fileselector offers functionality provided by getstring and
listbox (that contains the dir/filenames) widgets coupled with an
autolocator utility and file name masking.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

Here are the options that can be set or queried with setopt() and
getopt() functions.


 WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a pointer
	to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to associate some
	extra data with a widget.


 WT_XPOS   (long *)
 WT_YPOS   (long *)
 WT_WIDTH  (long *)
 WT_HEIGHT (long *)
 WT_LABEL  (char *)

	These options are referred to the shell widget that acts as
	container for the widgets that fileselector is composed of.
	See shell widget manual for more info.


 WT_FONT (char *)

	Not available.  If there's a demand I can add an option for
	setting the font for all the fileselector compoments using one
	(shell, buttons, label, getstrings and listbox).  Now all those
	use their own defaults.


 WT_LIST_LENGHT (long *)

	Set / get how many directories / filenames are shown on the
	listboxes.  See listbox widget manual for more info.


 WT_FILESEL_PATH (char *)
 
	Set / get the path filesector will use for reading the files from.
	Default is current directory.


 WT_FILESEL_FILE (char *)
 
	Set / get the default file name, default is "".


 WT_FILESEL_MASK (char *)
 
	Set / get the mask used to filter the shown filenames.
	Mask understands the normal 'glob' symbols (*, ?, [])
	used by shells. For example "*.html" or "[a-k]*.??".


 WT_ACTION_CB (void *) (widget_t *, char *filename)

	Set / get the function that will be called when user presses the
	'OK' button in the fileselector. The function will get the
	absolute filename of the selected file. Clicking 'Cancel' or
	the fileselector close gadget, will invoke the callback with
	filename set to NULL. Note that if you'll need the filename
	later you'll have to copy it elsewhere. Argument string will
	be free when the function returns.
