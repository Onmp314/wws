 The dial widget class
 ---------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *dial = wt_create (wt_dial_class, <parent>);


 2 Description
 -------------

The dial widget lets user to pick a value between given minimum and
maximum values with a dial `needle'.

Widget needs the WT_VALUE_MIN and WT_VALUE_MAX options to be set before
realization.

*NOTE*:  Because dial widget width and height are dependent on each
other, you'll have to set both when changing dial widget size.  Programs
using the dial widget have to link math library for sin, cos and atan
functions used by the widget `dial'.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

Here are the options that can be set or queried with setopt() and
getopt() functions.


WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a
	pointer to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to
	associate some extra data with a widget.


WT_XPOS (long *)

	Set / get the X position of the widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window.


WT_YPOS (long *)

	Set / get the Y position of the widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window.


WT_WIDTH (long *)

	Set / get the width of the widget.


WT_HEIGHT (long *)

	Set / get the height of the widget.


WT_FONT (char *) / (WFONT **)

	Set the family for font used in the value label(s). Get pointer
	to the font used.


WT_VALUE_MIN (char *)

	Set / get the `minimum' value represented as a string.  Has to
	be set before realization.


WT_VALUE_MAX (char *)

	Set / get the `maximum' value represented as a string.  Has to
	be set before realization.


WT_VALUE (char *)

	Get user selected value or set the default value.  Value should
	be between minimum and maximum values and represented as a
	string.  Default value is (minimum + maximum) / 2.


WT_VALUE_DECIMALS (long *)

	How many decimals will be used with WT_VALUE.  Default is is
	zero (ie.  values are expected to be integers).  Numbers given
	with WT_VALUE_MIN, WT_VALUE_MAX and WT_VALUE option strings
	should have as many decimals as set here (so that label width
	for the user selected value can be set to a suitable value).


WT_MODE (long *)

	Set / get the dial shape.  Permitted values are:
		DialHalfCircle
		DialFullCircle, min / max value at WT_ALIGNMENT position

	With the default DialHalfCircle, minimum value is at right and
	maximum at left.  With DialFullCircle minimum is at the position
	set with the WT_ALIGNMENT option.


WT_ALIGNMENT (long *)

	Set / get the dial `needle' minimum position in the dial.
	Permitted values are:
		AlignTop
		AlignBottom
		AlignLeft
		AlignRight (default)

	For a half circle dial AlignBottom equals AlignTop.
