 The `form' widget class
 -----------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *form = wt_create (wt_form_class, <parent widget>);
	/*
	 * add childs to form ...
	 */


 2 Description
 -------------

 The form widget is a composite widget which is used as a container for
childs widgets. The child windows are placed at the positions you specified
for them using the WT_XPOS and WT_YPOS configuration options.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

 For each configuration option the widget supports the name of the
configuration option (WT_<something>), the type of the argument (eg. long *)
you pass to wt_setopt()/wt_getopt() for this option, possible values, their
meaning and a description of what the option does is given.


 WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a pointer
	to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to associate some
	extra data with a widget.


 WT_XPOS (long *)

	Set the X position of the form widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The X position is ignored if
	the parent widget places the childs (like box and pane widget).
	Default is 0.


 WT_YPOS (long *)

	Set the Y position of the form widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The Y position is ignored if
	the parent widget places the childs (like box and pane widget).
	Default is 0.


 WT_WIDTH (long *)

	Set the width of the form widget. If the width is == 0 (which is the
	default) then the form will make itself wide enough so that its
	children will fit into the working area.


 WT_HEIGHT (long *)

	Set the height of the form widget. If the height is == 0 (which is
	the default) then the shell will make itself high enough so that its
	children will fit into the working area.
