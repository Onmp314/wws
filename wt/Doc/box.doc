 The `box' widget class
 ----------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *box = wt_create (wt_box_class, <parent widget>);
	/*
	 * add childs to box ...
	 */


 2 Description
 -------------

 The box widget is a composite widget. It arranges its childs in matrix-from
(ignoring the positions you set for the childs using WT_XPOS and WT_YPOS).

 The default behavior for a box is to place childs side by side in a row
beginning at the left border until the right edge of the box is reached.
Then there will be a "linefeed" and a new row is started.

 Horizontal distance between childs and vertical distance between rows can
be set by the user. The box can be configured to place childs in columns
beginning at the top until the bottom is reached and then to perform a
"colunmfeed" to start a new column.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

 For each configuration option the widget supports the name of the
configuration option (WT_<something>), the type of the argument (eg. long *)
you pass to wt_setopt()/wt_getopt() for this option, possible values, their
meaning and a description of what the option does is given.


 WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a pointer
	to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to associate some
	extra data with a widget.


 WT_XPOS (long *)

	Set the X position of the box widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The X position is ignored if
	the parent widget places the childs (like box and pane widget).
	Default is 0.


 WT_YPOS (long *)

	Set the Y position of the box widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The Y position is ignored if
	the parent widget places the childs (like box and pane widget).
	Default is 0.


 WT_WIDTH (long *)

	Set the width of the box widget. If the width is == 0 (which is the
	default) then the box will make itself wide enough so that all childs
	fit into one row (if OrientHorz has been selected) or into one
	column (if OrientVert has been selected).


 WT_HEIGHT (long *)

	Set the height of the box widget. If the width is == 0 (which is the
	default) then the box will make itself high enough so that all childs
	fit into one row (if OrientHorz has been selected) or into one
	column (if OrientVert has been selected).


 WT_ORIENTATION (long *)

	Select the orientation in which childerens are placed. Possible values
	are:
	- OrientHorz (default): place childs in rows.
	- OrientVert: place childs in columns.


 WT_HDIST (long *)

	Set the horizontal distance between childs. Default is 6 pixels.


 WT_VDIST (long *)

	Set the vertical distance between childs. Default is 6 pixels.
