 The `shell' widget class
 ------------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *shell = wt_create (wt_shell_class, <parent widget>);


 2 Description
 -------------

 Shell widgets are application main windows with a border, a title bar, exit
and iconify gadgets and a working area, but can be configured to be a popup
shell (ie have no title bar) or even have no border.

 Shell widgets are composite widgets, ie. you usually add childs to them.
In most cases shell widgets will have a top widget as its parent.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

 For each configuration option the widget supports the name of the
configuration option (WT_<something>), the type of the argument (eg. long *)
you pass to wt_setopt()/wt_getopt() for this option, possible values, their
meaning and a description of what the option does is given.


 WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a pointer
	to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to associate some
	extra data with a widget.


 WT_XPOS (long *)

	Set the X position of the shell widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The special value UNDEF
	will make the window manager "ask" the user where to place the window
	when it is created. Default value is UNDEF.


 WT_YPOS (long *)

	Set the Y position of the shell widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The special value UNDEF
	will make the window manager "ask" the user where to place the window
	when it is created. Default value is UNDEF.


 WT_WIDTH (long *)

	Set the width of the working area of the shell widget (ie excluding
	border and titlebar). If the width is == 0 (which is the default)
	then the shell will make itself wide enough so that its children will
	fit into the working area.


 WT_HEIGHT (long *)

	Set the height of the working area of the shell widget (ie excluding
	border and titlebar). If the height is == 0 (which is the default)
	then the shell will make itself high enough so that its children will
	fit into the working area.


 WT_LABEL (char *)

	Set the title of the shell widget (which will appear in the title
	bar of the window if the shell was configured to have a title bar).
	Default is the empty string (ie no title).


 WT_MODE (long *)

	Select an appearance for the shell widget. Possible values are:
	- ShellModeMain (default): shell has border and title bar
	- ShellModePopup: shell has a border but no title bar
	- ShellModeNoBorder: shell has neither a border nor a title bar


 WT_ICON_STRING (char *)

	Set/get the string used on the window icon. If this is not
	set the window title will be used.


 WT_ACTION_CB (void (*cb) (widget_t *w))

	Install a callback function that is called when the user clicks on the
	close gadget of the shell window. If no callback is installed (ie
	the function pointer is NULL) wt_break(1) will be called which exits
	wt_run().
