 The `select' widget class
 ------------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *select = wt_create (wt_select_class, <parent>);


 2 Description
 -------------

The select widget lets user to pick a string from a given list using
string input and a popup list.  Widget needs the WT_LIST_ADDRESS option
to be set before realization.

Note that popup list is clipped to the dialog window.  So if there's not
enough space for open list, make more room with the containers.  If you
need just a little bit of space, you might also use WT_LIST_HEIGHT
option to limit how many list items are shown at the time.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

Here are the options that can be set or queried with setopt() and
getopt() functions.


WT_USRVAL (long *)

	pointer to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to
	associate some extra data with a widget.

	Set / get the X position of the widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window.

	Has to be set before widget is realized.


WT_LIST_CURSOR (long *)

	Set / get the index of the currently selected item in the list.

	values on the list.  It's limited as default.
