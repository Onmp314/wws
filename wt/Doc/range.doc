 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

Here are the options that can be set or queried with setopt() and
getopt() functions.


WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a
	pointer to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to
	associate some extra data with a widget.


WT_XPOS (long *)

	Set / get the X position of the widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window.


WT_YPOS (long *)

	Set / get the Y position of the widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window.


WT_WIDTH (long *)

	Set / get the width of the widget.


WT_HEIGHT (long *)

	Set / get the height of the widget.


WT_FONT (char *) / (WFONT **)

	Set / get the font used in the value label(s).


WT_VALUE_MIN (char *)

	Set / get the `minimum' (shown on left or top of the slider)
	value represented as a string.  Has to be set before
	realization.


WT_VALUE_MAX (char *)

	Set / get the `maximum' (shown on right or bottom of the slider)
	value represented as a string.  Has to be set before
	realization.


WT_VALUE (char *)

	Get user selected value or set the default value.  Value should
	be between minimum and maximum values and represented as a
	string.  Default value is (minimum + maximum) / 2.


WT_VALUE_DECIMALS (long *)

	How many decimals will be used with WT_VALUE.  Default is is
	zero (ie.  values are expected to be integers).  Numbers given
	with WT_VALUE_MIN, WT_VALUE_MAX and WT_VALUE option strings
	should have as many decimals as set here (so that label width
	for the user selected value can be set to a suitable value).


WT_VALUE_STEPS (long *)

	Set / get how many `steps' slider will use between minimum and
	maximum values.  Has to be set before realization.
