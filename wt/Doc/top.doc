 The `top' widget class
 ----------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *top = wt_create (wt_top_class, NULL);
	/*
	 * add childs to `top' here
	 */
		.
		.
		.
	wt_realize (top);


 2 Description
 -------------

 Instances of the widget class `top' are special widgets that serve as the
root for a widget tree. You cannot see them on the screen. The function
wt_init() returns a top widget, but if your application needs more than
just one widget tree (ie. if you have several main-windows, popups, ...)
you can create more top-widgets as described in pragraph 1.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

 For each configuration option the widget supports the name of the
configuration option (WT_<something>), the type of the argument (eg. long *)
you pass to wt_setopt()/wt_getopt() for this option, possible values, their
meaning and a description of what the option does is given.


 WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a pointer
	to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to associate some
	extra data with a widget.
