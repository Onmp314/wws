 The `iconedit' widget class
 ---------------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *iconedit  = wt_create (wt_iconedit_class, <parent>);


 2 Description
 -------------

The iconedit widget is a simple bitmap editor. The widget includes the
editing area and the icon itself so that you'll see what it will look
in the real size. ATM the icon position is fixed into the top right
corner of the widget.

There's no option to get or set the icon bitmap because there are two
ways to do it; over the socket or from a window to another.  You'll get
the icon position on the widget with WT_ICON_XPOS and WT_ICON_YPOS
options and the icon size with WT_ICON_WIDTH and WT_ICON_HEIGHT options.
Widget window handle can be obtained by wt_widget2win() function.  The
iconeditor.c file that comes with the toolkit gives an example on what
to do with them.
