 The `viewport' widget class
 ---------------------------

 1 Usage
 -------

	#include <Wlib.h>
	#include <Wt.h>

	widget_t *viewport = wt_create (wt_viewport_class, <parent widget>);
	/*
	 * add a child to viewport later
	 */


 2 Description
 -------------

 Viewport widgets are composite widgets that have exactly one child widget.
A viewport consits of an area throu which you can see a rectangular part of
the child widget and two scrollbars that let you select the visible part of
the child.

 The sliders of the two scrollbars are automatically configured according to
the position and size of the child widget. The scrollbars will be updated
if you change size or position of the child via wt_setopt (child, ...) using
WT_XPOS, WT_YPOS, WT_WIDTH or WT_HEIGHT options.

 Even if you delete the child and install a new one the sliders will be
updated accordingly.


 3 Configuration Options
 -----------------------

 For each configuration option the widget supports the name of the
configuration option (WT_<something>), the type of the argument (eg. long *)
you pass to wt_setopt()/wt_getopt() for this option, possible values, their
meaning and a description of what the option does is given.


 WT_USRVAL (long *)

	Store a user defined value (which is a long, but you pass a pointer
	to it) in the widget. This is useful if you have to associate some
	extra data with a widget.


 WT_XPOS (long *)

	Set the X position of the viewport widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The X position is ignored if
	the parent widget places the childs (like box and pane widgets).
	Default is 0.


 WT_YPOS (long *)

	Set the Y position of the viewport widget, which is relative to the
	upper left corner of the parent window. The Y position is ignored if
	the parent widget places the childs (like box and pane widgets).
	Default is 0.


 WT_WIDTH (long *)

	Set the width of the viewport widget (including the scrollbars). If
	width == 0 (which is the default) the viewport widget will make itself
	wide enough so the child is totally visible. If you did not add a child
	the width defaults to 100.


 WT_HEIGHT (long *)

	Set the height of the viewport widget (including the scrollbars). If
	height == 0 (which is the default) the viewport widget will make itself
	wide enough so the child is totally visible. If you did not add a child
	the height defaults to 100.

 WT_MODE (long *)

	Specify what the viewport should do when you click on the slider and
	mode it. It can either move the window whenever you move the slider
	(ViewpLifeScroll) or only when you release the mouse button again
	(ViewpLazyScroll, which is the default).
