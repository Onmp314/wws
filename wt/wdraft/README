	W - DRAFT


When the program is started you'll be presented with a toolbar.  Any
images specified on the command line will be loaded and opened into Draft
windows.

The toolbar has icons for different tools.  The first ones are normal
graphics tools.  You'll select the tool by a left-click and get the tool
option dialog with a right-click.

The graphics can be entered to any drawing window just by left-clicking
for the first and second point.  If the primitive can have more than two
(control) points, you'll signify the end of points with a right-click.
Normally a right-click cancels the operation.  After you have specified
the primitive size / shape, you can position and paste it multiple times
on any drawing window.

With the new window dialog you can either specify a size for a new
window or use a fileselector to load an image and open a new window
for it.
