The following improvements need to be made to AmiGo:

Ability to Load/Save games.  This should use a standard format if possible.

Automatic scoring.

Ability to take back moves.

Variable board sizes.

Ability to use computer go players running as separate processes.
This would make it easy to link in many different players.

And, of course, a better Go player.
