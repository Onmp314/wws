	Reversi (w) 1996 by Eero Tamminen


These are Reversi games for my GameFrame framework:

creversi	Curses Reversi client
wreversi	W Window System Reversi client
reversid	Reversi daemon (server)


STARTING

Before starting a game one has to contact another game client.  This
happens either by setting up a server and accepting a connection or by
connecting yourself to another game server.

With curses versions one needs to use '-c' option to specify the address
into which to connect (e.g.  'creversi -c saturn.outer.space.org').  If
this option isn't used, the game will itself setup a server.  Graphical
user interface version(s) should have a separate configuration dialog
from which you can perform either of these actions.

After connecting another player, you can start the game and begin to
play.  Note that continuing (for clients that support board editing
before play) asks confirmation from the other player before proceeding.


REVERSI / OTHELLO RULES

Players position one stone onto the board at the time.  The opponent's
pieces that are between (horizontally, vertically and diagonally) the
new piece and the earlier pieces of the same color, will be converted to
the new color.  Only moves which convert opponent's pieces are legal.
Game ends when both players pass.  The player with most stones on the
board wins.


SERVER OPTIONS

The reversi server playing level (how deep the board checks for computer
move are) can be set with the '-l <number>' option.  The default server
level is 3 which is fast enough even for the lowliest of machines and
offers suitable opposition for beginners.  Levels above 4 begin to offer
serious resistance depending on who starts.
