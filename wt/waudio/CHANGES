W sample player / editor by Eero Tamminen

1995
- Made a simple GEM sample player for Kay Roemer's MiNT audiodev device.
- Converted it for W.

16.4.1996
- Converted my Wlib sample player for W toolkit and separated the
  audio device specific stuff better from other code.

20.4.1996
- Added some simple effects and sample part selection.

26.4.1996
- Completed change from single sample player to one that can manage as
  many samples as fits into memory (surely you got virtual memory?).
- Added cut & paste and undo for effects.

28.4.1996
- Divided the source into several files in preparation for addition of
  other modules like selection finetuning, special effects, filters and
  sample sythetizing.
- Added looping.

17.8.1996
- Updated for a new W toolkit version.
- Separated list and file handling functions from sampler.c to list.c.
- Improved the list management functions and added a new button to the
  list dialog for sample synthetizing.
- Started to code the sample synthetizing dialog and functions.

5.5.1997
- Tested with current Wt version and fixed a couple of places where
  wt_delete is called on a static widget pointer, but pointer value
  isn't set to NULL.

26.10.1997
- Ifdeffed sampler.c so that it can be compiled for x86-linux and
  modified source for latest Wlib.

10.2.1998
- Added sample playing speed and sync setting for linux.
