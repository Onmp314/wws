 This is a beta release of my little Toolkit for W. I consider it fairly
complete by now, except for three things:

 - some missing widgets (namely scale, multiline text input and menus)
 - only one ficus per application (not one for every toplevel window)
 - only one user-event-handler function per widget

 this may change in the future.


 What do you need to use it?

 - w1r3pl2 patched with all the diffs in patches/w1r3pl2-patches.tar.gz


 What is it?

 Well, The W Toolkit is a widget library that sits on top of Wlib. It provides
you with:

 - widget support functions
 - timeout handling
 - handling for additional inputs/outputs
 - a simple clipboard
 - some convenience functions for standard dialogs (alert, entrybox,
   popup, fileselsector).
 - widgets, of cause

 Widgets can be distinguished into two basic categories: 1) simple widgets, like
buttons, that contain no other widgets, and 2) composite widgets that are used
as containers for other widgets. Currently there are the following widgets:

 - simple ones:
   * push-button, radio-button, check-button
   * label (just like button, except you cannot push it down)
   * drawable (thing that you can draw into, what did you expect?)
   * scrollbar
   * icon-edit-widget
   * html-widget
   * (one line) text-input-widget
   * vt 52 widget
   * list box widget
   * fileselecto widget
   * (multiline) text display widget

 - composite ones:
   * shell (toplevel window with title bar etc)
   * box (arranges its children in a left-to-right top-to-bottom order)
   * pane (stacks its children in X or Y direction)
   * form (simply places childs where you told them via WT_XPOS, WT_YPOS)
   * viewport
   * Tk-like packer

 For documentation look into Doc/, for some test programs Test/.

 If you want to write widgets, there are a lot you can choose from:
multiline-textinput, menubar, menu-panes, status-bar, ...


have fun, Kay.
