Untested diffs for compiler warnigs:

* sign-bool.diff
	Some changes for GCC 4.x uchar* vs. char* warnings.
	They are not properly tested (both with compilers having
	signed and unsigned char etc)


I have also written W display/input code for several (X11) programs which
have separated that part clearly from rest of the sources. The files here
are:

* mountains.c
	A replacement for 'X_graphics.c' source file in the 'XMountains'
	fractal landscape (mountain) generator v2.2.

* hf-lab.c
	A replacement for 'x_iface.c' source file in the John Beale's
	HF-Lab (HeightField Labratory) v0.90.  HF-Lab itself can create
	light shaded view of the heightfield, but best results you'll of
	course get by ray-tracing the heightfield with a raytracer like
	POV-ray and then viewing it with wbm.  You can get latest HF-Lab
	from John Beale's home page at:  http://www.best.com/~beale/.

* heretic.c
	W new display/input code for (linux) Heretic.  As mouse isn't much
	of an input method, I strongly recommend a W version that supports
	key release events (SDL&GGI version of W does) as then you can use
	keyboard for playing.


NOTES

You need to do some changes to the program makefiles so that they'll
compile for W instead of X.  Mainly this is changing the X library
options to '-L/usr/local/lib -lW' and replacing X code file with
the W one...

Running these programs on 256-color resolution is recommended although
they work also with monochrome servers.  Then the output is dithered.

All the programs do heavy calculations, so don't even imagine running
them on a machine lacking FPU and a bit of 'Oomph'. :-)

------ original notes -------


here you should find a set of diffs for bigger programs - however, there's
currently only one for wearth, pardon: xearth-1.0. I once had a patch for
gnuplot-3.5, but I seem to have lost it. Anyway, have fun!
