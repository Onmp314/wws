MISSING MANUAL PAGES

	fs_direct2mono		FS-dither direct8/24 image to mono

	qsin/qcos		lookup table functions for sin/cos (degrees)
	isqrt			integer square root
	w_fill			slow&silly flood fill

	generic Wt manual page	(rest could be in HTML format)


Btw.  which would be better, explicitly linking manual pages with same
content to each other, or using the `.so man3/manual.3w' manual page
redirection syntax like I currently do?
