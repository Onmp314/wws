.TH WPERFMON 1 "Version 1, Release 4" "W Window System" "W PROGRAMS"
.SH NAME
wperfmon \- a performance measurement tool for W
.SH SYNOPSIS
wperfmon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wperfmon
is the new tools to check if everything works OK and how much time is needed
for some kind of operations. The first and probably most important thing is
the null operation which simply send NOP packets to the wserver to calculate
the socket overhead. All other calls really should be slower than that. It
doesn't attempt to give you netto graphic performance numbers, but this may
change in future.
.PP
Be sure that the system is free of load when running wperfmon. It is probably
also a wise idea to let it be the only client running because the time
measurement routines are a bit stupid...
