.SH NAME
creversi \- Reversi / Othello board game client for console
.SH SYNOPSIS

creversi [-c \fIaddress\fP]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fICReversi\fP is a curses version of Reversi / Othello board game
clients for the networked turn based, two player game framework by
Eero Tamminen.
.SH STARTING GAME
Before starting a game one has to contact another game client.  This
happens either by setting up a server and accepting a connection or by
connecting yourself to another game server.
.PP
With curses version one needs to use '-c' option to specify the address
into which to connect (e.g.  'creversi -c saturn.outer.space.org').  If
this option isn't used, the game will itself setup a server.
.PP
After connecting another player, you can start the game and begin to
play.  Note that continuing (for clients that support board editing
before play) asks confirmation from the other player before proceeding.
.SH REVERSI / OTHELLO RULES
Players position one stone onto the board at the time.  The opponent's
pieces that are between (horizontally, vertically and diagonally) the
new piece and the earlier pieces of the same color, will be converted to
the new color.  Only moves which convert opponent's pieces are legal.
Game ends when both players pass.  The player with most stones on the
board wins.
