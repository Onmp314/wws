.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIWGomoku\fP is a W version of Gomoku board game clients for the networked
turn based, two player game framework by Eero Tamminen.
.SH STARTING GAME
Before starting a game one has to contact another game client.  This
happens either by setting up a server and accepting a connection or by
connecting yourself to another game server.    You can do this from
the configuration dialog.
.PP
After connecting another player, you can start the game and begin to
play.  Note that continuing (for clients that support board editing
before play) asks confirmation from the other player before proceeding.
.SH GOMOKU RULES
Players position a stone at the time and the game is won by the person
who first gets five of his/her stones onto a row, either horizontally,
vertically or diagonally.
.PP
It's proven that the starter can always win the game, but with amateur
players that's not an issue (mainly concerns players on inter/national
level, who will play the Pente/Renju variant which sets some limitations
to the starting player).
