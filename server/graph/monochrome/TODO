bfmask8.c:	done	(uchars instead of ushorts/ulongs)
bitblit.c:	done	(-"-)
bitmap.c:	done	(was ok)
dline.c:	done	(uchars instead of ushorts or ntohs() bits)
line.c:		done	(uchars instead of ulongs)
mouse.c:	done	(ntohl())
point.c:	done	(ntohs() bit)
scroll.c:	done	(uchars instead of ulongs)
text.c:		done	(ntohl() ulongs)

These could be implemented better.  My way was just Quick'an-Dirty^tm
conversion from the packed monochrome driver.  On big endian machines
(network byte order) ntohs / ntohl do nothing and on most(?) little
endian machines there's a single assembler instruction to do them
so that shouldn't slow this driver down that much.

It isn't yet completely portable.  Mouse drawing still does long
accesses to short boundaries...
